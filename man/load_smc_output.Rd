\arguments{
\item{results_directory}{The folder in which the results are stored.}

\item{ggmcmc}{(optional) Output in tidy format for plotting in ggmcmc package.}

\item{ggsmc}{(optional) Output in tidy format for plotting in ggsmc package.}

\item{as.mcmc}{(optional) Output treats particles as different MCMC chains.}

\item{as.enk}{(optional) Output treats particles as an ensemble.}

\item{which.targets}{(optional) The indices of the targets to output (defaults to all).}

\item{directory_prefix}{(optional; for nested output only) The first part of the name of the directory within results_directory that contains the results. (default is "ilike", giving a directory of results_directory/ilike_smc)}

\item{external_log_weights}{(optional; for nested output only) The weights of the importance points external to the current folder. (default is 1, to be used at the top level of nested output)}

\item{nesting_level}{(optional; for nested output only) The level of nesting at which to extract points. (default is 0, representing the top level of nested output)}

\item{factor}{(optional; for nested output only) The factor from which to extract points. (default is 0)}
